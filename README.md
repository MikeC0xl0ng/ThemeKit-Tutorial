# ThemeKit Tutorial

### Installation
- download the [ThemeKit .exe file](https://github.com/MikeC0xl0ng/ThemeKit-Tutorial/blob/8f88f54c3d18602cf276fe6ccd6c4eb706b8dbd4/theme.exe)
- put the file in the following path: C:\Program Files\Theme
- add a new environment variable (we need it to be able to access theme.exe by digitin `theme` and not `C:\Program Files\Theme\theme`)
  - if you are running Windows => press `Win` and search for environment variables, then click `Add` and add the path of the theme.exe file, in our case is 
    >C:\Program Files\Theme
